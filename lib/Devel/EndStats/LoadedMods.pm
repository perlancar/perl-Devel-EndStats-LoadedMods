=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module installs an END block to dump a list of loaded modules with their
versions. It simply lists the content of C<%INC> keys, with versions taken from
corresponding C<$VERSION> package variables. The output is easily diff-able.

I first wrote this to debug why my script doesn't work when run under cron
(using system perl) but works when run under my shell (using perlbrew's perl).


=head1 SEE ALSO

There are probably already existing modules on CPAN when I wrote this module,
but I couldn't find them.

Related modules to print information at the end of program run:
L<Devel::EndStats>.
